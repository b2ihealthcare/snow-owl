# Administrative REST API reference

## Introduction

This document provides a list of available REST endpoints, which can be used for taking scripted backups of a Snow Owl Server instance.

## REST API

The following URLs are exposed to assist the administrator in creating backups without stopping the server (accepted and produced content type is  `text/plain`  in all cases except errors, where an HTML message may be returned):
