# Introduction

Snow Owl® is a terminology server and a collaborative terminology authoring platform. The authoring platform maintains terminology artifacts developed by a team and supported by business workflows that are driven by external task management systems like Bugzilla and JIRA. With its modular design, the server can maintain multiple terminologies where new terminologies can be plugged-in to the platform. The functionality of Snow Owl is exposed via a REST API.

Clients can easily access and query SNOMED CT, LOINC®, ATC, ICD-10, and dozens of additional terminologies via REST or Java APIs. Collaborative distributed authoring is also supported, including creating and maintaining your own local code systems, mapping between terminologies, and creating terminology subsets.

Snow Owl is maintained by B2i Healthcare.
