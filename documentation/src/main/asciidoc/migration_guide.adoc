= Data migration guide

== Introduction

This document lists the required data migration steps for each release

== 4.7.0

There are two ways to migrate data from 4.6 to 4.7. Either run the provided sql statements against the database or use the shell scripts which migrate the data in three steps. 

=== SQL
The `migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_terminology_snomed.sql` file contains the necessary SQL statements for the migration. Execute each sql statement against the database to migrate your data.

=== Shell scripts
The `migration_4.6_to_4.7` folder contains three shell scripts for the migration.

The first script `snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_1_table_creation.sh` creates the new Code System tables for the given terminology. Use the following command to run the script:

--------------------------
./migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_1_table_creation.sh admin snomed
--------------------------

The second script `snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_2_table_population.sh` populates the previously created tables with the necessary data. Use the following command to run the script:

--------------------------
./migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_2_table_population.sh admin snomed SNOMEDCT sct
--------------------------

The third script `snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_3_old_table_deletion.sh` deletes the old Code System tables which are no longer needed. Use the following command to run the script:

--------------------------
./migration_4.6_to_4.7/snowowl_migration_4.6_to_4.7_phase_3_old_table_deletion.sh admin snomed
--------------------------

=== Index update 
After the database migration, Code System and Code System Version indexes must be updated. In order to do this, start the terminology server with the `-Dsnowowl.reindex=true` VM argument. If the reindex argument is missing or false, the index update process is skipped.
