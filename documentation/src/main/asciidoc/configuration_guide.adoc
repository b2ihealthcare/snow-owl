= Configuration guide

== Introduction

This document helps configuring each installed component for use with Snow Owl Server.

== Components

=== Operating system

Install `system-config-firewall-tui`:

--------------------------
# yum install dbus dbus-python system-config-firewall-tui
# reboot
--------------------------

Using the text-based UI, enable these Trusted Services:

SSH:: For remote administration of the server
WWW (HTTP):: For accessing Bugzilla's SOAP API and web-based UI

Also open access to the following ports:

8080/TCP:: Used by Snow Owl Server's REST API
2036/TCP:: Used by the Net4J binary protocol connecting Snow Owl clients to the server
11389/TCP:: Used by the LDAP server

=== Database server software

Edit `/etc/my.cnf` to adjust settings for the MySQL server. Recommended settings are shown below, but there are lots
of additional tunable settings to choose from depending on the hardware configuration used; please see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-variables.html for the full set of system variables.

./etc/my.cnf
--------------------------
include::configuration/my.cnf[]
--------------------------

Restart the mysql service to make sure changes are picked up:
--------------------------
# service mysqld restart
Stopping mysqld:                                           [  OK  ]
Starting mysqld:                                           [  OK  ]
--------------------------

=== LDAP

==== Setting up a connection from Apache Directory Studio

Open Apache Directory Studio, create a new connection using the first button on the "`Connections`" toolbar:

image::ldap_new_connection.png[role="text-center"]

Enter connection name, hostname, and port, then hit `Next >` to go to the next page in the wizard:

image::ldap_new_connection_page1.png[role="text-center"]

Set authentication method to `Simple Authentication`, enter Bind DN `uid=admin,ou=system` and password `secret`. Click
`Check Authentication` to make sure the values are accepted, then dismiss the wizard with `Finish`:

image::ldap_new_connection_page2.png[role="text-center"]

After connecting, you are advised to change the default password for user `system`. In order to do so, expand node
`ou=system` and select the person `admin`. The editor will now display related user information:

image::ldap_admin_user_details.png[role="text-center"]

Double click on `userPassword` to open the password change dialog, select `SSHA-512` as the hash method. To see the new
password as it is being entered, check `Show next password details`:

image::ldap_change_password.png[role="text-center"]

To see if the password was changed successfully:

* Close the connection using the third button on the lower left toolbar named `Close Connection`,
* Right-click the item representing the connection to open its properties with the context menu item at the bottom,
* Change the previously entered default bind password to the updated value on the `Authentication` tab,
* Re-connect to the server using `Open Connection`.

==== Creating a partition for Snow Owl Server

Right-click on the item representing the connection, and select "Open Configuration":

image::ldap_connection_context_menu.png[role="text-center"]

An editor opens with the server configuration; select the `Partitions` tab. An `examples` partition is added by default,
which should be removed. Add a new partition named `snowowl` and fill out the details (ID and suffix):

image::ldap_configuration.png[role="text-center"]

Save the editor and restart the server to apply changes in partitions.

--------------------------
# service apacheds-2.0.0_M12-default restart
Stopping ApacheDS - default...
Stopped ApacheDS - default.
Starting ApacheDS - default...
--------------------------

==== Using LDIF dumps

B2i provided LDAP packages include the following content:

schema.ldif:: LDAP schema to use for authorization (contains definitions for permissionId and role)
permissions.ldif:: All available permissions in the system
roles.ldif:: All available roles in the system
pm.ldif:: Maps permissions to roles
update.sh:: An update script using `ldapmodify` and `ldapadd` commands against a running LDAP instance to update it
based on the files above

Optionally the assembly can contain two additional files:

users.ldif:: All users available in the system
rm.ldif:: Maps roles to users in the system

The update script will also make use of these files if any of them exist.

Install the `openldap-clients` first to make use of the script:

--------------------------
# yum install openldap-clients
--------------------------

Before updating the LDAP server, it is advised to shut down the service, and create a backup from the contents
of folder `/var/lib/apacheds-2.0.0_M12/default`, so it can be restored easily if the script fails.

Restart the server, then create a new ldif-<version> folder and unzip the contents of the LDIF archive into
this folder. Finally, execute the script to update the contents of LDAP:

--------------------------
# chmod u+x update.sh

# ./update.sh
Not specified LDAP URI parameter, using ldap://localhost:10389
adding new entry "cn=permission, ou=schema"
adding new entry "ou=attributeTypes, cn=permission, ou=schema"
...
modifying entry...
--------------------------

In case an error occurs, the executed command and the error response will be displayed. Errors will also be logged
to a `{file_name}.errors` file, where the `{file_name}` refers to the file being processed (eg. `permissions.errors`).

When executing the script it is possible to get the following errors:

* `ERR_250_ALREADY_EXISTS` (or any synonym of ALREADY_EXISTS)
* `ERR_54 Cannot add a value which is already present : snomed:compare:automap`
* `ERR_335 Oid 2.25.128424792425578037463837247958458780603.1 for new schema entity is not unique`

This is expected as most of the time the LDAP instance will already contain an existing definition of some entries and/or
schema entities. If you notice other errors (either during script execution or when using the LDAP), roll back your instance
to a previous state from a backup.

By default the update script will execute against the LDAP instance running locally at `ldap://localhost:10389`; if
you'd like to run the script against a remote LDAP server (or the LDAP is listening on a different port), you can do it by
specifying the LDAP_URI parameter:

--------------------------
# ./update.sh ldap://<host>:<port>
--------------------------

==== Creating a new user from Directory Studio

Go to LDAP Browser view, right click on the Domain component (DC) and add new entry via `New` > `New entry`:

image::ldap_new_user_context_menu.png[role="text-center"]

Create a new entry from scratch:

image::ldap_new_user_new_entry.png[role="text-center"]

Select `inetOrgPreson` object from the wizard, add it as a selected object class:

image::ldap_new_user_class.png[role="text-center"]

Configure the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN). Specify the common name (CN), surname (SN) and unique ID (uid):

image::ldap_new_user_rdn.png[role="text-center"]

Open the added node in an editor, right click in the editor and select `New Attribute`:

image::ldap_new_user_new_attribute.png[role="text-center"]

Select `userPassword` attribute, click `Finish`, then enter user password in the `Password Editor` dialog:

image::ldap_new_user_password.png[role="text-center"]

Finally, add a `uniqueMember` attribute to the Administrator group.

Select the new user's node in the tree, right click and select `Copy Entry / DN`:

image::ldap_new_user_copy_entry.png[role="text-center"]

Right click the `uniqueMember` attribute of the `Administrator` node, select `New Value` and paste the previously copied DN
of the new user as the value:

image::ldap_new_user_add_to_group.png[role="text-center"]

The operation takes place after pressing Enter or removing the focus from the edited field.

=== Task Tracking

==== Finishing the installation

Create a MySQL user for Bugzilla using the command-line client:

--------------------------
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE, LOCK TABLES,
       CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, DROP, REFERENCES ON bugs.*
       TO bugs@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'bugzilla_pwd'; // <1>

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
--------------------------
<1> Replace `bugzilla_pwd` with a generated password

Return to folder `/var/www/html/bugzilla` and edit `localconfig` to reflect the DB user name and password changes:

./var/www/html/bugzilla/localconfig
--------------------------
# Enter your database password here. It's normally advisable to specify
# a password for your bugzilla database user.
# If you use apostrophe (') or a backslash (\) in your password, you'll
# need to escape it by preceding it with a '\' character. (\') or (\)
# (Far simpler just not to use those characters.)
$db_pass = 'bugzilla_pwd';
--------------------------

Apply the following patch on `/var/www/html/bugzilla/Bugzilla/DB/Mysql.pm` to make Bugzilla work with MySQL 5.6:

.Mysql.pm.patch

--------------------------

Finally, run `./checksetup.pl` again. Bugzilla should be reachable at http://localhost/bugzilla after configuration is completed. Details
of the administrator user will be requested at the end of the process:

--------------------------

Adding a new user setting called 'display_quips'

Looks like we don't have an administrator set up yet. Either this is
your first time using Bugzilla, or your administrator's privileges
might have accidentally been deleted.

Enter the e-mail address of the administrator: info@b2international.com // <1>
Enter the real name of the administrator: Administrator // <2>
Enter a password for the administrator account: // <3>
Please retype the password to verify:
info@b2international.com is now set up as an administrator.
Creating initial dummy product 'TestProduct'...

Now that you have installed Bugzilla, you should visit the 'Parameters'
page (linked in the footer of the Administrator account) to ensure it
is set up as you wish - this includes setting the 'urlbase' option to
the correct URL.
--------------------------
<1> Enter the e-mail address of the administrator user
<2> Add a display name for the Bugzilla administrator
<3> Enter the password of the administrator user

Once Bugzilla has created its table structure, you can increase the maximum table size by executing the following commands:

--------------------------
mysql> USE bugzilla
mysql> ALTER TABLE attachments
       AVG_ROW_LENGTH=1000000, MAX_ROWS=20000;
--------------------------

==== Administration of Bugzilla

See http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.6/en/html/administration.html for a comprehensive list of administrative tasks and options.

After logging in with an account that has administrative privileges, click the `Administration` link on the top. The
general administrative page will appear as shown below:

image::bugzilla_administration.png[role="text-center"]

Core parameters can be set by selecting `Parameters` on the top left. The following fields are recommended to be adjusted:

===== Required Settings
urlbase:: Set to the the common leading part of all URLs which are related to Bugzilla (ex.: http://server.domain/bugzilla/)
cookiepath:: The common path segment of the URL under which Bugzilla cookies are allowed to be read; as noted in the description
above the field, its value should begin with '/' (ex.: /bugzilla/)

===== General
maintainer:: The email address entered here is shown on various pages in Bugzilla where contacting the administrator is
suggested

===== User Authentication
requirelogin:: Set to On if you want to limit access to registered users only (disabling anonymous browsing of bugs)
emailregexp and emailregexpdesc:: Depending on requirements, the administrator may limit login names to values that are not actual
email addresses. In this case, set the fields as suggested in the description above, ie. `\^[^@]+` and `Local usernames, no @ allowed.`
createemailregexp:: to disable user-initiated registration (requiring the administrator to create each user account by hand), clear
the field's contents

image::bugzilla_emailregexp.png[role="text-center"]

===== Attachments
maxattachmentsize:: The maximum size in kilobytes for attachments. Change it to `10240` (10 MB)

===== Dependency Graphs
webdotbase:: To disable relying on an external service for rendering dependency graphs of issues (as populated by
default), clear the field's contents

===== Email
mail_delivery_method:: If an SMTP server is available, configure its address and authentication properties below;
otherwise, set this value to `None` to disable sending mail altogether
smtpserver:: Clear the field's contents if no SMTP server is used
whinedays:: Set to 0 if mail delivery is not enabled and/or there's no need to send users regular notifications about
their assigned bugs which remained in NEW state
use-mailer-queue:: When set to `On`, e-mails are sent asynchronously; to use this feature, the jobqueue.pl daemon needs to be started.
For more information on this topic, please see http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.6/en/html/api/jobqueue.html.

==== Product setup

Bugzilla tracks the authoring aspects of Snow Owl clients in multiple products. Per-product configuration is shown in the following
parts of the guide.

Opening the preference page `Snow Owl > Bugzilla Products` displays the supported products in the client and their
corresponding product names in Bugzilla. If you have different product names added in the issue tracker, you have to
adjust the product name as shown in the image. Make sure to press Enter or click in the table to apply the change in
the field before hitting `Apply` or `OK` to apply the changes. Products which are not handled by contributed task
editors are displayed with an empty context view only:

image::bugzilla_products.png[role="text-center"]

To match the default value set in client preferences, create a product called `Snow Owl Collaborative Editing` by clicking `Products`
on Bugzilla's administration page. Add a description, optionally set a version to discern individual releases, and keep `Open for bug entry`
checked to allow users to file issues under this product. After creating the product, a warning will be issued by Bugzilla to create a
component as well. Add the following components with the `Component`, `Component description` and `Default assignee` fields populated:

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Component name
|Description

|Single author with single reviewer
|Single author with single reviewer

|Dual authors with single reviewer – Dual authoring

==== Authentication against LDAP

Bugzilla is capable to authenticate against the external LDAP server which Snow Owl Server will use. Setting it up
requires the following steps to be taken:

* Go to `Administration > Parameters > LDAP` and populate the following fields:

LDAPserver:: hostname:port pair for contacting the server, eg. `localhost:10389`
LDAPBaseDN:: set to `dc=snowowl,dc=b2international,dc=com`
LDAPuidattribute:: set to `uid`
LDAPmailattribute:: set to `uid`

* Click `Save Changes` to apply changes
* Go to `Administration > Parameters > User Authentication`, scroll down to `user_verify_class` and make `LDAP` the top-most
item
* Click `Save Changes` to finish


To test, click the `Log Out` link at the top and try to log in with your bugzilla username and LDAP password. If it was sucessful,
you should see bugzilla's landing page. If you see an error message about not able to connect to the LDAP server, then run the
following command as root:

--------------------------
# setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
--------------------------

This will allow Apache to make network connections.

If LDAP is still not working and you are being locked out from bugzilla, you can change back bugzilla to use its internal database for
authentication, instead of LDAP. To do so, edit `/var/www/html/bugzilla/data/params`, deleting LDAP from the `user_verify_class` entry:

./var/www/html/bugzilla/data/params
--------------------------
...
'user_verify_class' => 'DB',
...
--------------------------

If users are already entered in the LDAP server, it is important to synchronize Bugzilla's user database to contents of LDAP so tasks can be
assigned to all users. Run the following script to perform synchronization:

--------------------------
# cd /var/www/html/bugzilla
# ./contrib/syncLDAP.pl
--------------------------

For general questions and documentation, please refer to chapter 3.1.10. LDAP Authentication in the documentation:
http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.6/en/html/parameters.html.

== Snow Owl Server

=== DB connection

Create a MySQL user for the Snow Owl Server by connecting to the DBMS via the console:

--------------------------
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: root_pwd // <1>

mysql> CREATE USER 'snowowl'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'snowowl_pwd'; // <2>
--------------------------
<1> Replace `root_pwd` with the password for the `root` user in MySQL
<2> Replace `snowowl_pwd` with a generated password for the `snowowl` user in MySQL

Save the following shell script to an executable file to create databases and grant privileges for user `snowowl`:

.snowowl_create_db.sh
--------------------------
include::scripts/snowowl_create_db.sh[]
--------------------------

B2i provided MySQL dumps (if present) can be found in `/opt/snowowl-community_{version}/resources/*.sql` files
after unpacking the installation archive. To load terminology data, save and execute the following script:

.snowowl_load_db.sh
--------------------------
include::scripts/snowowl_load_db.sh[]
--------------------------

Update `snowowl_config.yml` to use LDAP authentication and set the MySQL password for `snowowl`, created earlier:

--------------------------
repository:
  ...

  database:
    ...
    username: snowowl
    password: snowowl // <1>
--------------------------
<1> Update MySQL username and password, if neccessary

=== File Authentication

To use file based authentication, configure the `auth` property to `PROP_FILE` and the `fileAuth` configuration object to the desired username/password in the `snowowl_config.yml` file.

WARNING: Building Snow Owl produces a ready to use, deployable package with the default passwords (`fileAuth` and `database` properties) configured. Usage of the default password configuration is not recommended in production environments. 

=== LDAP Authentication

To use the configured LDAP instance, adjust `snowowl_jaas_configuration.properties` to
include the host name of the LDAP server and the LDAP administrator password:

./opt/snowowl-community_{version}/configuration/snowowl_jaas_configuration.properties
--------------------------
LDAP {
    org.eclipse.equinox.security.auth.module.ExtensionLoginModule required
        extensionId="com.b2international.snowowl.authentication.ldap.ldapLoginModule"
        ...
        userProvider="ldap://<ldap_host>:10389/" // <1>
        usePool=false
        snowOwlBase="dc=snowowl,dc=b2international,dc=com"
        bindDnUser="uid=admin,ou=system"
        bindDnPassword="secret" // <2>
        ...
};
--------------------------
<1> Replace `<ldap_host>` with the host name of the LDAP server to connect to
<2> Replace `secret` with the LDAP administrator's password

=== Memory settings

Heap size used by Snow Owl can be adjusted in `dmk.sh`; look for the following seciton:

--------------------------
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS \
    -Xms8g \
    -Xmx10g \
    -XX:MaxPermSize=512m \
--------------------------

`Xms` sets the minimum heap size, `Xmx` sets the maximum heap size, and `XX:MaxPermsize` sets the PermGen space used by the JVM.

=== OSGi console

The OSGi console can be accessed both via ssh and telnet. Configuration settings to for remote access can be found in `osgi.console.properties`.
The default settings are:

./opt/snowowl-community_{version}/repository/ext/osgi.console.properties
--------------------------
telnet.enabled=true
telnet.port=2501
telnet.host=localhost
ssh.enabled=true
ssh.port=2502
ssh.host=localhost
--------------------------

Further information on how to enable/disable the OSGi console can be found here:
http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.6.1.RELEASE/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch08.html.

For opening a telnet connection to the server, type:

--------------------------
$ telnet localhost 2501
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
osgi>
--------------------------

=== Web Server Configuration

Snow Owl Server uses Tomcat as its built-in web server for administrative and RESTful services. The configuration
settings for the web server can be found in `tomcat-server.xml`. Detailed information on configuring the different
elements can be found here: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/index.html. The most important settings
are the port numbers for HTTP and HTTPS protocols:

./opt/snowowl-community_{version}/configuration/tomcat-server.xml
--------------------------
<Service name="Catalina">
   <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
              redirectPort="8443" />
   <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
              maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
              clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
              keystoreFile="configuration/keystore"
              keystorePass="changeit"/>
--------------------------

=== Web Server Administrative Console application

The Admin Console is a web application for managing the Virgo Server instance powering Snow Owl Server. The default
location of the admin console is at http://localhost:8080/admin.

The Admin Console is a password-protected page; to configure users allowed to access the Admin Console, change settings
in file `org.eclipse.virgo.kernel.users.properties`. The username-password pair configured by default is `user=admin, pwd=adminpwd`:

./opt/snowowl-community_{version}/configuration/org.eclipse.virgo.kernel.users.properties
--------------------------
 ##################
 # User definitions
 ##################
 user.admin=adminpwd

 ##################
 # Role definitions
 ##################
 role.admin=admin
--------------------------

More information on administrative user access control can be found on the following pages:
http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.6.1.RELEASE/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch09.html and
http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.6.0.M04/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch13s06.html#configuring-authentication.

=== Configuration reference

Snow Owl Server comes with a predefined default configuration file, which can be used to tweak various system parameters.
The configuration file is in YAML format, and located at `/opt/snowowl-community_{version}/snowowl_config.yml`. You
can read more about how to create/write such files here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML.

The configuration file has a hierarchical structure, which is defined by modules. Different modules can have different
configurations, a module is defined by its name, which should start a line in the file. Configuration parameters in a
module should be indented by two spaces following the module's name.

The next section contains the reference of our currently supported configuration parameters. Each parameter should be
present in a module configuration as described above.

Snow Owl Server refuses to start if the configuration file contains syntactical or structural errors. The cause of the
problem can be found in the `log.log` file, or in the console if you've redirected the output of the server's startup
process.

==== SNOMED CT Component Identifier Configuration

Snow Owl's SNOMED CT identifier service an be configured to be either using the built-in or IHTSDO's external Component Identifier Service (CIS).  The configuration needs to be placed within the *snomed/ids* section.
If omitted, then default configuration will be used, which is the built-in (embedded) service based on the index store allocating ids in a sequential fashion.

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Default
|Description

|service
|EMBEDDED 
|`EMBEDDED` or `CIS` - The service used to generate ids.

|source
|INDEX
|`INDEX` or `MEMORY` - The source of the generated ids.  `MEMORY` is used for testing.

|strategy
|SEQUENTIAL
|`SEQUENTIAL` or `RANDOM` - The strategy of the id generation.

|cisBaseUrl
|
|The service's URL with port and without context root.

|cisContextRoot
|
|The context root of the id generation service.

|cisUserName
|
|The registered user name at the CIS site.

|cisPassword
|
|The password for the registered user name at the CIS site.

|cisClientSoftwareKey
|Snow Owl
|The client software key to be persisted within CIS as reference.

|cisNumberOfPollTries
|1
|The maximum number of tries when polling jobs of bulk requests.

|cisTimeBetweenPollTries
|1000
|The time to wait between 2 job polling actions It is in milliseconds.

|cisNumberOfReauthTries
|2
|The maximum number of re-authentication attempts when a 401 Not authorized response is received.

|cisMaxConnections
|100
|Maximum number of simultaneous connections that Snow Owl can make to the CIS host via HTTP.

|maxIdGenerationAttempts
|1000
|Maximum number of attempts any non-CIS ID generator will take to generate a single SNOMED CT identifier, if exceeded it throws an exception.
|===

Example for using the built-in service with random ids using the index as the source:

--------------------------
snomed:
  ...
  ids:
    service: EMBEDDED
    source: INDEX
    strategy : RANDOM
    cisBaseUrl : <cis_host_and_port>
    cisContextRoot : api
    cisUserName : <your-cis-username>
    cisPassword : <your-cis-password>
    cisClientSoftwareKey : Snow Owl dev. deployment
    cisNumberOfPollTries : 1
    cisTimeBetweenPollTries : 1000
    cisMaxConnections: 100
  ...
--------------------------


Example for using IHTSDO's external CIS service:

--------------------------
snomed:
  ...
  ids:
    service : CIS
    cisBaseUrl : <cis_host_and_port>
    cisContextRoot : api
    cisUserName : <your-cis-username>
    cisPassword : <your-cis-password>
    cisClientSoftwareKey : Snow Owl dev. deployment
    cisNumberOfPollTries : 1
    cisTimeBetweenPollTries : 1000
    cisMaxConnections: 100
  ...

=== Logging

Log files are stored under `./opt/snowowl-community_{version}/serviceability` directory of the Snow Owl server.
The following log files are created:

`logs/log.log`:: Generic system trace log file, all log messages are written into this file. In case the file reaches a
pre-defined maximum size, the system will create additional files named `log_1.log`, `log_2.log`, etc. This log serves
two main purposes:

1. It provides global trace files that capture high-volume information regarding the Virgo’s internal events. The files
are intended for use by support personnel to diagnose runtime problems.

2. It provides application trace files that contain application-generated output. This includes output generated using
popular logging and tracing APIs including the OSGi LogService, as well as output generated by calls to `System.out` and
`System.err`. These files are intended for use by application developers and system administrators. An application is
defined as a scope so a single bundle will not get its own log file unless it is a Web application Bundle or is included
in a scoped plan or a par file.

`logs/access/*.log`:: Web container access log files in the same format as those created by standard web servers. The log
files are prefixed with the string `localhost_access_log`, have a suffix of `.txt`, use a standard format for identifying
what should be logged, and do not include DNS lookups of the IP address of the remote host.

`eventlogs/eventlog.log`:: The `EVENT_LOG_FILE` appender logs only important events and thus the volume of information is
lower.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_user_audit.log`:: Events with business significance will be logged in this file.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_user_access.log`:: User access events are logged in this log file. Both authorized and unauthorized
access is logged.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_import.log`:: Import processes log into this file detailed information about import.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_export.log`:: Export processes log into this file detailed information about export.

Detailed information on the configuration on the logging configuration can be found here:
http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.6.1.RELEASE/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch11.html.

Currently, default logging appenders for the log targets above look like this:

--------------------------
<appender name="LOG_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
    <file>serviceability/logs/log.log</file>
    <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.FixedWindowRollingPolicy">
        <FileNamePattern>serviceability/logs/log_%i.log</FileNamePattern>
        <MinIndex>1</MinIndex>
        <MaxIndex>4</MaxIndex>
    </rollingPolicy>
    <triggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
        <MaxFileSize>10MB</MaxFileSize>
    </triggeringPolicy>
    <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder">
        <Pattern>[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}] %-5level %-28.28thread %-64.64logger{64} %X{medic.eventCode} %msg %ex%n</Pattern>
    </encoder>
</appender>
--------------------------

In this setting, the administrator can set the location of the log file, the maximum size of the log file and the
total number of files rolling over. Documentation on the logging configuration settings can be found here: http://logback.qos.ch.
