|=======================

== Installing

In this section we'll run you through installing Snow Owl in a production environment on a CentOS 6.8 machine with an external MySQL database and LDAP based authentication/authorization.

=== Operating system

Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS using the minimal ISO image. As hardware configurations and the
corresponding exact installation steps can be different from machine to machine, please refer to the 
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[installation guide]
on Red Hat's site for details (covers both distributions).

NOTE: The text-based installer does not offer all options compared to the graphical one; you may have to connect a physical
monitor, or use the built-in KVM management capabilities of the server (if supported) to perform the installation from the
graphical environment. The installed system only needs an SSH connection for administration.

When creating the partition layout, keep in mind that Snow Owl Server requires at least 50-150 GB of disk space when branched
terminology editing is used extensively.

After logging in to the installed system, update installed packages to the latest version and add EPEL as a package
repository for dependencies. For non-CentOS installations, please see the the
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F[usage instructions] on the EPEL wiki.

--------------------------
# yum update
# reboot
# yum install epel-release // <1> 
--------------------------
<1> Works only if CentOS was installed

Create a non-login user for Snow Owl Server to run as:

--------------------------
# useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin snowowl 
--------------------------

For optimal indexing performance, consult the "Production Deployment" sections of 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/hardware.html[Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide]. In particular, the
following settings are applicable to an installation of the terminology server:

--------------------------
# sysctl settings, to be added to /etc/sysctl.conf or equivalent

vm.swappiness = 1
vm.max_map_count = 262144

# "noop" I/O scheduler, should be set in eg. /etc/rc.local for solid state disks:

echo noop > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
--------------------------

=== Network

Install `system-config-firewall-tui`:

--------------------------
# yum install dbus dbus-python system-config-firewall-tui
# reboot
--------------------------

Using the text-based UI, enable these Trusted Services:

SSH:: For remote administration of the server

Also open access to the following ports:

8080/TCP:: Used by Snow Owl Server's REST API
2036/TCP:: Used by the Net4J binary protocol connecting Snow Owl clients to the server

=== Database

An extensive installation guide for getting MySQL Community Edition from a yum repository is available at 
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-yum-repo-quick-guide/en/index.html#repo-qg-yum-fresh-install[the MySQL Documentation Library].
The required steps are summarized below.

Install MySQL's yum repository with the following command:

--------------------------
# yum install -y mysql57-community-release
--------------------------

The repository for MySQL 5.7 should be enabled by default. Confirm by opening `/etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo`:

--------------------------
# yum repolist enabled | grep mysql <1> 
--------------------------
<1> 5.7 should appear somewhere

Install MySQL Community Server using yum (also run an update so packages get replaced with the community version):

--------------------------
# yum install -y mysql-community-server
# yum update -y
--------------------------

Start the service and wait for first-time initialization to complete:

--------------------------
# chkconfig --list mysqld
# service mysqld start
Starting MySQL.                                            [  OK  ]
--------------------------

After a few minutes, check if the database service is still running and enabled at startup:

--------------------------
# service mysqld status
mysqld (pid  1757) is running...
--------------------------

--------------------------
# chkconfig mysqld on
# chkconfig --list mysqld
mysqld          0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
--------------------------

Get the temporary password and change it

--------------------------
# grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
# mysql -uroot -p
mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MyNewPass4!';
--------------------------
  
NOTE: The entered new root password will be used later for configuration and administrative purposes; do not forget this password.

Edit `/etc/my.cnf` to adjust settings for the MySQL server. Recommended settings are shown below, but there are lots
of additional tunable settings to choose from depending on the hardware configuration used; please see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html for the full set of system variables.

./etc/my.cnf
--------------------------
include::configuration/my.cnf[]
--------------------------

Restart the mysql service to make sure changes are picked up:
--------------------------
# service mysqld restart
Stopping mysqld:                                           [  OK  ]
Starting mysqld:                                           [  OK  ]
--------------------------

=== Configuring database

Create a MySQL user for the Snow Owl Server by connecting to the DBMS via the console:

--------------------------
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: root_pwd // <1>

mysql> CREATE USER 'snowowl'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'snowowl_pwd'; // <2>
--------------------------
<1> Replace `root_pwd` with the password for the `root` user in MySQL
<2> Replace `snowowl_pwd` with a generated password for the `snowowl` user in MySQL

Save the following shell script to an executable file to create databases and grant privileges for user `snowowl`:

.snowowl_create_db.sh
--------------------------
include::scripts/snowowl_create_db.sh[]
--------------------------

B2i provided MySQL dumps (if present) can be found in `/opt/snowowl-{edition}_{version}/resources/*.sql` files
after unpacking the installation archive. To load terminology data, save and execute the following script:

.snowowl_load_db.sh
--------------------------
include::scripts/snowowl_load_db.sh[]
--------------------------

=== Java

Download the "`Linux X64`" edition, and install it with yum:

--------------------------
# yum install jdk-8u121-linux-x64.rpm
--------------------------

=== LDAP

Install the latest (2.4.x) OpenLDAP with yum:

--------------------------
# yum -y install openldap compat-openldap openldap-clients openldap-servers openldap-servers-sql openldap-devel
--------------------------

Start the service, and enable it to run when system boots up:

--------------------------
# systemctl start slapd.service
# systemctl enable slapd.service
--------------------------

Next, run the `slappasswd` to create an LDAP root password. Please take note of this root password, the entire hashed value that is returned as output and starts {SSHA}, as you'll use it throughout this article.
Afterwards, you can import the provided LDIF files via `ldapadd`/`ldapmodify` commands (Role and Permission schema).

=== Configuring LDAP

==== Using LDIF dumps

B2i provided LDAP packages include the following content:

permission_schema.ldif:: LDAP schema to use for authorization (contains definitions for permissions)
permissions.ldif:: All available permissions in the system
roles.ldif:: All available roles in the system
pm.ldif:: Maps permissions to roles
update.sh:: An update script using `ldapmodify` and `ldapadd` commands against a running LDAP instance to update it
based on the files above

Optionally the assembly can contain two additional files:

users.ldif:: All users available in the system
rm.ldif:: Maps roles to users in the system

The update script will also make use of these files if any of them exist.

Install the `openldap-clients` first to make use of the script:

--------------------------
# yum install openldap-clients
--------------------------

Before updating the LDAP server, it is advised to shut down the service, and create a backup, so it can be restored easily if the script fails.

Restart the server, then create a new ldif-<version> folder and unzip the contents of the LDIF archive into
this folder. Finally, execute the script to update the contents of LDAP:

--------------------------
# chmod u+x update.sh

# ./update.sh
Not specified LDAP URI parameter, using ldap://localhost:10389
adding new entry "cn=permission, ou=schema"
adding new entry "ou=attributeTypes, cn=permission, ou=schema"
...
modifying entry...
--------------------------

In case an error occurs, the executed command and the error response will be displayed. Errors will also be logged
to a `{file_name}.errors` file, where the `{file_name}` refers to the file being processed (eg. `permissions.errors`).

When executing the script it is possible to get the following errors:

* `ERR_250_ALREADY_EXISTS` (or any synonym of ALREADY_EXISTS)
* `ERR_54 Cannot add a value which is already present : snomed:compare:automap`
* `ERR_335 Oid 2.25.128424792425578037463837247958458780603.1 for new schema entity is not unique`

This is expected as most of the time the LDAP instance will already contain an existing definition of some entries and/or
schema entities. If you notice other errors (either during script execution or when using the LDAP), roll back your instance
to a previous state from a backup.

By default the update script will execute against the LDAP instance running locally at `ldap://localhost:10389`; if
you'd like to run the script against a remote LDAP server (or the LDAP is listening on a different port), you can do it by
specifying the LDAP_URI parameter:

--------------------------
# ./update.sh ldap://<host>:<port>
--------------------------

==== Using Apache Directory Studio

Open Apache Directory Studio, create a new connection using the first button on the "`Connections`" toolbar:

image::ldap_new_connection.png[role="text-center"]

Enter connection name, hostname, and port, then hit `Next >` to go to the next page in the wizard:

image::ldap_new_connection_page1.png[role="text-center"]

Set authentication method to `Simple Authentication`, enter Bind DN of your root user and its password. Click
`Check Authentication` to make sure the values are accepted, then dismiss the wizard with `Finish`:

image::ldap_new_connection_page2.png[role="text-center"]

==== Creating a new user using Apache Directory Studio

Go to LDAP Browser view, right click on the Domain component (DC) and add new entry via `New` > `New entry`:

image::ldap_new_user_context_menu.png[role="text-center"]

Create a new entry from scratch:

image::ldap_new_user_new_entry.png[role="text-center"]

Select `inetOrgPreson` object from the wizard, add it as a selected object class:

image::ldap_new_user_class.png[role="text-center"]

Configure the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN). Specify the common name (CN), surname (SN) and unique ID (uid):

image::ldap_new_user_rdn.png[role="text-center"]

Open the added node in an editor, right click in the editor and select `New Attribute`:

image::ldap_new_user_new_attribute.png[role="text-center"]

Select `userPassword` attribute, click `Finish`, then enter user password in the `Password Editor` dialog:

image::ldap_new_user_password.png[role="text-center"]

Finally, add a `uniqueMember` attribute to the Administrator group.

Select the new user's node in the tree, right click and select `Copy Entry / DN`:

image::ldap_new_user_copy_entry.png[role="text-center"]

Right click the `uniqueMember` attribute of the `Administrator` node, select `New Value` and paste the previously copied DN
of the new user as the value:

image::ldap_new_user_add_to_group.png[role="text-center"]

The operation takes place after pressing Enter or removing the focus from the edited field.

=== Snow Owl Server

Unpack an official distribution archive into `/opt`, installing `unzip` first if not already present; change permissions
on the created folder:

--------------------------
# yum install unzip
# unzip snowowl-{edition}-{version}-mysql.zip -d /opt
# chown -Rv snowowl:snowowl /opt/snowowl-{edition}_{version}
--------------------------

==== Update Snow Owl's Configuration

Update `snowowl_config.yml` to use LDAP as identity provider and set the MySQL password for `snowowl`, created earlier:

--------------------------
identity:
  providers:
    - ldap:
        uri: ldap://<host>:<port>
        baseDn: <your-base-dn>
        rootDn: <DN of the ROOT user>
        rootDnPassword: <password of the ROOT user>
        usePool: false

repository:
  ...

  database:
    ...
    username: snowowl
    password: snowowl // <1>
--------------------------
<1> Update MySQL username and password, if neccessary

==== Memory settings

Heap size used by Snow Owl can be adjusted in `dmk.sh`; look for the following seciton:

--------------------------
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS \
    -Xms12g \
    -Xmx12g \
--------------------------

`Xms` sets the minimum heap size, `Xmx` sets the maximum heap size used by the JVM.

==== OSGi console

The OSGi console can be accessed both via `ssh` and `telnet`. Configuration settings for remote access can be found in `osgi.console.properties`.
The default settings are:

./opt/snowowl-{edition}_{version}/repository/ext/osgi.console.properties
--------------------------
telnet.enabled=true
telnet.port=2501
telnet.host=localhost
ssh.enabled=true
ssh.port=2502
ssh.host=localhost
--------------------------

Further information on how to enable/disable the OSGi console can be found here:
http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.6.4.RELEASE/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch08.html.

For opening a telnet connection to the server, type:

--------------------------
$ telnet localhost 2501
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
osgi>
--------------------------

==== Logging

Log files are stored under `./opt/snowowl-{edition}_{version}/serviceability` directory of the Snow Owl server.
The following log files are created:

`logs/log.log`:: Generic system trace log file, all log messages are written into this file. Logs files are created for each day
with the following file name format `log_%d{yyyy-MM-dd}`. Snow Owl will keep 90 days worth of history in this folder before starting to remove files.
This log serves two main purposes:

1. It provides global trace files that capture high-volume information regarding the Virgo’s internal events. The files
are intended for use by support personnel to diagnose runtime problems.

2. It provides application trace files that contain application-generated output. This includes output generated using
popular logging and tracing APIs including the OSGi LogService, as well as output generated by calls to `System.out` and
`System.err`. These files are intended for use by application developers and system administrators. An application is
defined as a scope so a single bundle will not get its own log file unless it is a Web application Bundle or is included
in a scoped plan or a par file.

`logs/access/*.log`:: Web container access log files in the same format as those created by standard web servers. The log
files are prefixed with the string `localhost_access_log`, have a suffix of `.txt`, use a standard format for identifying
what should be logged, and do not include DNS lookups of the IP address of the remote host.

`eventlogs/eventlog.log`:: The `EVENT_LOG_FILE` appender logs only important events and thus the volume of information is
lower.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_user_audit.log`:: Events with business significance will be logged in this file.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_user_access.log`:: User access events are logged in this log file. Both authorized and unauthorized
access is logged.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_import.log`:: Import processes log into this file detailed information about import.

`logs/snowowl/snowowl_export.log`:: Export processes log into this file detailed information about export.

Detailed information on the configuration on the logging configuration can be found here:
http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.6.4.RELEASE/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch11.html.

Currently, default logging appenders for the log targets above look like this:

--------------------------
<appender name="LOG_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
	<file>serviceability/logs/log.log</file>
	<rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
		<fileNamePattern>serviceability/logs/log_%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</fileNamePattern>
		<!-- keep 90 days' worth of history -->
  		<maxHistory>90</maxHistory>
	</rollingPolicy>
	<filter class="ch.qos.logback.core.filter.EvaluatorFilter">
		<evaluator class="ch.qos.logback.classic.boolex.OnMarkerEvaluator">
			<marker>SNOW_OWL_USER_ACCESS</marker>
		</evaluator>
		<onMismatch>ACCEPT</onMismatch>
		<onMatch>DENY</onMatch>
	</filter>
	<encoder class="ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder">
		<Pattern>[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}] %-5level %-28.28thread %-64.64logger{64} %X{medic.eventCode} %msg %ex%n</Pattern>
	</encoder>
</appender>
--------------------------

In this setting, the administrator can set the location of the log file, the maximum size of the log file and the
total number of files rolling over. Documentation on the logging configuration settings can be found here: http://logback.qos.ch.

==== Web Server Configuration

Snow Owl Server uses Tomcat as its built-in web server for administrative and RESTful services. The configuration
settings for the web server can be found in `tomcat-server.xml`. Detailed information on configuring the different
elements can be found here: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/config/index.html. The most important settings
are the port numbers for HTTP and HTTPS protocols:

./opt/snowowl-{edition}_{version}/configuration/tomcat-server.xml
--------------------------
<Service name="Catalina">
   <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
              redirectPort="8443" />
   <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
              maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
              clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
              keystoreFile="configuration/keystore"
              keystorePass="changeit"/>
--------------------------

==== Web Server Administrative Console application

The Admin Console is a web application for managing the Virgo Server instance powering Snow Owl Server. The default
location of the admin console is at http://localhost:8080/admin.

The Admin Console is a password-protected page; to configure users allowed to access the Admin Console, change settings
in file `org.eclipse.virgo.kernel.users.properties`. The username-password pair configured by default is `user=admin, pwd=adminpwd`:

./opt/snowowl-{edition}_{version}/configuration/org.eclipse.virgo.kernel.users.properties
--------------------------
 ##################
 # User definitions
 ##################
 user.admin=adminpwd

 ##################
 # Role definitions
 ##################
 role.admin=admin
--------------------------

More information on administrative user access control can be found on the following pages:
http://www.eclipse.org/virgo/documentation/virgo-documentation-3.6.4.RELEASE/docs/virgo-user-guide/html/ch09.html and
