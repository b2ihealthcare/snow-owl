# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 2015-03-26
### Added
- `WRP-89`: both `FULL` and `DELTA` imports are now separating incoming import files into "layers" based on the effective time columns, and individual layers get imported in order. This enables importing the `20150131` INT RF2 release delta, which includes components from `20140731` as well. The import process can now create versions after importing each "layer" for all import types.
  
  Note that the above mentioned `20150131` release would require "re-tagging" of an already released `20140731` version, which is not supported, or placing the additional content on the existing `20140731` version branch as a patch. This, however, would make the extra `20140731` content available on that version and that version **only**; it would be visible neither from `MAIN`, nor from `20150131`.
  
  The current implementation issues a warning when such cases are encountered; the extra content will become visible on `MAIN` and `20150131`, but not on version `20140731`, which is left untouched. A possible workaround is to import `20140731` from a delta with disabled version creation, then import the `20150131` delta with enabled version creation.

## 2015-03-19
### Added
- `WRP-135`: added properties `taskId` and `versionId` to the export configuration object to allow exporting content from task branches. URLs for exporting no longer include the version segment.
  * version/taskId is accepted, but not applicable (no tasks on versions)
  * when taskId left out, it means MAIN or head of a particular version
- Added the `transientEffectiveTime` property to the export configuration object for specifying 
effective time values in export files, if unpublished components are present. Valid values are:
  * `""` or not setting the property: uses `Unpublished` in exported files
  * `"NOW"`: uses the current server date in exported files
  * dates in `yyyyMMdd` format, eg. `"20150319"`: uses the specified date in exported files
  * anything else result in return code 400 bad request, date is not validated in terms of earlier/later (only proper format)
  Note: unpublished components are filtered out from `DELTA` exports if the export configuration specifies an ending effective time.

### Changed
- Changed the export service to export components from _all_ modules if the `moduleIds` property of the export configuration object is not set. The previous behavior resulted in empty export files under the assumption that _no_ modules should be exported.
- Querying or exporting a non-existent export config returns now code 404 as opposed to 200 and an empty object.
- After downloading the export result, the export config is cleaned up.

## DEV2.1 - 2015-03-05
### Changed
- Make the `Accept` header mandatory for requests to "B2i" URLs, and produce `application/json` 
responses on "Browser" URLs. This means that the latter endpoints will be hit when entered in a 
web browser's URL bar, making testing easier.
- Increase concept children collection performance by using a combination of low-level calls. This 
brings the test case of `123037004`'s children down from ~22 seconds to ~350 ms.
- Sort description search results by relevance, and add offset and limit to fetch search results in 
smaller segments.
- Split the API documentation into two sets: the administrative interface with the code system 
listing is separated from SNOMED CT services. The API viewer's own URL bar can be used to switch 
between generated documentation endpoints; two shortcuts were also added. The default URL is changed 
to http://localhost:8080/snowowl/admin/api-viewer/ .

## DEV2 - 2015-02-20
### Added
- New API viewer category for URLs specific to the IHTSDO Browser:
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/concepts/{SCTID}` for retrieving concepts and related details
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/concepts/{SCTID}/children` for retrieving concept children
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/descriptions?query={query_string}` for retrieving matching
descriptions
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/constants` for getting response constant FSNs and identifiers

### Changed
- `effectiveDate` and `effectiveTime` properties on SNOMED CT components and code system
versions now universally follow the short `yyyyMMdd` format (also applies when creating new
versions), other dates should use ISO8601 
- `Accept-Language` is required on all new endpoints which return descriptions, as Snow Owl
Server stores descriptions with different language codes and acceptability side-by-side
- Constants must be retrieved on a version/task basis, as the FSN of these enumeration
values can change between versions, tasks

### Removed
- `isLeafStated` is not returned, as Snow Owl Server holds a mixed set of relationships
which matches the inferred view only

## DEV1 - 2015-02-13
### Added
- `WRP-26`: Support importing deltas without corresponding unchanged artefacts
- `WRP-82`: Enable REST operation to support imports on branches
- `WRP-88`: Add support for namespace to REST API
- Added folder `delta-import-examples` which includes a set of RF2 release .zip 
files, containing the minimally required content for each change. A separate 
`readme.txt` file within the folder has additional instructions on how these 
archives can be used.

### Changed
- URLs under and including `/snomed-ct/imports` no longer require specifying the 
version to use as a path variable;
- The input object for `POST` `/snomed-ct/imports` should now include both the 
version as well as the task identifier, if applicable:
```
{
  "version": "MAIN",
  "taskId": "SO-001",
  "type": "DELTA",
  "languageRefSetId": "900000000000508004",
  "createVersions": false
}
```
- `GET` `/snomed-ct/imports/{importId}` will return information about the ongoing
import and the original values from the import configuration:
```
{
  "type": "DELTA",
  "version": "MAIN",
  "taskId": "SO-001",
  "createVersions": false,
  "languageRefSetId": "900000000000508004",
  "id": "89feb6f4-f6a7-4652-90b9-b89b6b8587ce",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "startDate": "2015-02-13T15:39:56Z",
  "completionDate": "2015-02-13T15:41:05Z"
}
```
### Removed
- To keep the release file's size small, no indexes and SQL dumps have been 
attached; the ones from the previous release can be used instead. A database
reload is required.
