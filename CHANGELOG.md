## 6.0.0

### Breaking changes

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating your application to Snow Owl 6.0.0.

#### Datasets created before 6.0.0
Snow Owl v6.0.0 does not support Lucene based indexes anymore. We've decided to remove that module completely in favor of the now fully supported and stable Elasticsearch based module.
All datasets (including the ones created with the experimental Elasticsearch module) need a full `reindex`. 
See [Admin Console Reference Guide](/documentation/src/main/asciidoc/administrative_console_reference.adoc#diagnostics-and-maintenance) for details.

#### API changes
Removed `offset` properties from all collection resource representation classes. `Offset+Limit` based paging is resource-intensive, therefore it has been completely removed. 
Your queries should either search for the topN hits or if you need to scroll a large result set, then use the `scrollId` returned in the collection resource (alternatively you can scroll a live result set using the `searchAfter` parameter).
Read more about scrolling here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-scroll.html

#### @Analyzed annotations
Replaced `@Analyzed` with `@Text` and `@Keyword` to better reflect Elasticsearch field types `text` and `keyword`.

  * Support filtering SNOMED CT Descriptions by `case significance` (ECL or ID set) (416d1a9)
  * Support filtering by `term regex` in description search (e47ae40)
  * Support multiple SNOMED CT Reference Set IDs in `isActiveMemberOf` filter
  * Support language refset, acceptableIn and preferredIn filtering in description search (59e7b57)
- SNOMED CT ECL
  * ECL implementation now compatible with latest v1.3 spec (https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCECL/Previous+Versions)
  * Support nested expressions in `memberOf` rules (v1.2 spec change)

  * `Void` return types have been changed to Boolean (fixes unanswered client side requests)
  * `Empty`-ish values are accepted in `filterBy*` methods (empty `Collection`s and empty `String` values)
- SNOMED CT RF2 import console command now accepts a single Code System short name instead of a descriptor file (bd7aea3d56822b405feb4adbf039cd4ce4599729)
- SNOMED CT Identifier Generation:
  * Improve Sequential ID generation by skipping exponentially growing chunks of reserved/assigned IDs in order to find the next available ID faster (#180) 
- SNOMED CT Classification changes:
  * Enabled classification of concepts with the UK Clinical extension module
  * Improved performance of SNOMED CT Classification by keeping the initially computed taxonomy in memory until normal form generation and change (https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/181)
  * Generate inferred relationship IDs in bulk [5.x] (#176)
- File Attachment API now accepts any kind of file not just zip files (3b814b2)

## 5.10.1

### Changed
- Elasticsearch module now properly configures dynamic mapping on Object/Map field types

### Bugs
- Searching for SNOMED CT Concept with termFilter throws score evaluation exception

## 5.10.0

### Breaking changes
- `_id` document fields now indexed with doc_values enabled
- `EMBEDDED` identifier service now operates on its own index, named `snomedids`
- SNOMED CT Description index mapping now uses more precise analyzers to provide the best possible text matches when search for description terms
  * Exact term searches now possible via the new `term.exact` index field
  * Prefix searches now return better results (via the new `term.prefix` field), because the mapping now uses the `edgengram` tokenfilter to generate `1..20` length prefixes for each SNOMED CT Description term
- NOTE: Due to the above mentioned changes, datasets created before 5.10.0 require a **full reindex**

### Added
- Full (but still **experimental**) Elasticsearch support (https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/147)
  * Supported elasticsearch version is `2.3.3`
  * Snow Owl starts a local-only Elasticsearch node by default, but it is possible to configure the node to connect to a cluster of others
  * Configure the Elasticsearch node with the `configuration/elasticsearch.yml` ES configuration file
  * This index API implementation does not support the `SHA-1` `_hash` field on revision documents thus it cannot skip them from a revision compare result and will return them. Clients should query the base and head of the branch and remove the false positive hits manually.
- Configuration options
  * Added `numberOfShards` configuration option to repository.index node in snowowl_config.yml
  * Added `commitConcurrencyLevel` configuration option to repository.index node in snowowl_config.yml
  
### Changed
- Low-level Index API chanages (see https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/147 for details)
- API changes:
  * JSON representations now include non-null values instead of non-empty
  * SNOMED CT Concept inactivation properties are no longer auto-expanded. The new `inactivationProperties()` expand parameter need to be added to the expand parameter list in order to retrieve them.

### Bugs
- Fixed memory leak when using `gzip` compression on the in-JVM Net4j connection
- Fixed invalid SNOMED CT Identifier state when supplying the identifiers instead of generating them (1e4488e35884cfa6f458471e73c7fd6943239722)

### Performance
- Greatly improved performance of index queries by using filter clauses in boolean queries instead of must clauses (eac279977bf2b0c49da949701136ba19260b5aef)

## 5.9.0

### Breaking changes
- Datasets created before 5.9.0 require a **full reindex** in case you would like to use the new branch compare API (or you are using the old review-based compare feature). 

### Added
- New branch compare Java API (https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/145)
- Index documents now store a `_hash` field. The value is computed from the semantic content of the document using `SHA-1` (requires reindex).

### Changed
- Classification Java API now returns only SNOMED CT concept identifiers
- Include component type in commit notification's new/changed/deleted buckets (470f4e99e42d7c2c1c2e4159ea2003bc51c7aa08)
- Include version and codesystem changes in commit notification events
- Enable gzip compression by default on all Net4j protocols (https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/146)

### Removed
- `compression` configuration option from RPC

### Bugs
- Branch compare now skips unchanged components even if they had changed, but got reverted to their original form in the meantime (fixed as part of https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/145)

## 5.8.6

### Changes
- Description preferred acceptability update no longer update acceptabilities of other description (5f012c30a8346bc4905bafa92d9920ce9525dc3a)

### Bugs
- Fix concept document indexing when changing destination of a relationship in place (4a0ab3a5bcb9b5108785b799f86a1258f88c65e9)

### Changes
- Allow editing immutable properties on unreleased SNOMED CT components (0e1444b9bac543c1cf5c22e90823c4ea42edd077)
  * `typeId`, `destinationId` on SNOMED CT Relationships
  * `typeId`, `term`, `languageCode` on SNOMED CT Descriptions

- Fixed missing internal SNOMED CT ECL package export entry (required by ide and ui plugins)
- Fixed duplicate repository ID shown in diagnostic messages
- Fixed existing db index detection when ensuring index on CDO_CREATED columns

## 5.8.0

### Added
- Health Status has been added to Repository instances (https://github.com/b2ihealthcare/snow-owl/pull/138)

## 5.0.0

### Breaking changes

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating your application to Snow Owl 5.0.0.

#### Datasets created before 5.0.0
Snow Owl v5.0.0 no longer supports nested index directory format. The new format is flat, branches do not have their own directories under the corresponding terminology repository's root index folder. Branching and revision information are coded into each document and each terminology component has multiple documents in the index, which is called `revision index` and the documents are `revisions`. Additionally with the new index format, Snow Owl moved from Lucene v4.9.0 to v5.5.0. Indexes, that still use the old index API, but depend on the new Lucene version, should be accessible and readable by Lucene v5.5.0.

To support migration of incompatible datasets, Snow Owl v5.0.0 comes with a `reindex` command, which can be used to create the new index for any dataset based on the contents of the relational database. See updated [Admin Console Reference Guide](/documentation/src/main/asciidoc/administrative_console_reference.adoc#diagnostics-and-maintenance) for details.

#### Java API changes
Due to index format changes, public APIs (generic and/or SNOMED CT terminology related) - that used the old format - become obsolete, and either marked with deprecated annotation or have been completely removed. See the affected public APIs in the Removed section. 

#### Review API changes
In general the `Review API` still works the same way as in the `4.x` versions, but the new, changed, deleted concept ID sets might contain non-Concept identifiers when a member of a `Relationship/Description` changes, but the corresponding `Relationship/Description` does not. It is recommended to fetch the container `SNOMED CT Concept` identifier by querying the *source* branch for the new or changed Relationship/Descriptions, and extracting the SNOMED CT Concept identifier from either the conceptId or sourceId properties. Querying deleted revisions from the tip of a branch is currently not supported, see next section. 

With this change and limited capabilities, Snow Owl will no longer support the current version of the `Review API` starting from the next release (`5.1.0`), and it will replace it with a more generic `Branch Compare API`. This new API will return the new/changed/deleted document identifiers directly without trying to be smart and replace the document identifier with the corresponding container (root resource, like the `SNOMED CT Concept`) component identifier. API consumers will be responsible for fetching and computing the final compare result based on the actual changes between the branches, if they would like to still show the review in the scope of a `SNOMED CT Concept`. This enables `Snow Owl` to use the same `Branch Compare API` for different terminology implementations and the API will provide access points to query the proper revision of new/changed/deleted components (currently it only supports the latest revision, which returns `HTTP 404 Not Found` for deleted components).

### Added
- Maintenance commands:
 * `snowowl reindex <repositoryId> <failedCommitTimestamp>` - Reindexes the currently available database content from scratch, or from the specified commitTimestamp (if a previously initiated reindex process has failed at some point)
 * `snowowl optimize <repositoryId> <maxSegments>` - Optimizes the underlying index for the repository to have the supplied maximum number of segments (default number is 1)
 * `snowowl purge <repositoryId> <branchPath> <purgeStrategy>` - optimizes the underlying index by deleting unnecessary documents from the given branch using the given purge strategy (default strategy is `LATEST`, available strategies are `ALL`, `LATEST`, `HISTORY`)
- New search options for SNOMED CT Reference Set Members:
 * `acceptabilityId`
 * `characteristicTypeId`
 * `correlationId`
 * `descriptionFormat`
 * `mapCategoryId`
 * `operatorId`
 * `targetComponent`
 * `unitId`
 * `valueId`
- New `revisionCache` configuration option in `repository` section. Enables/Disables CDO revision cache based on its value (default value is `true`).
- New `index` configuration options under `repository` section:
 * `commitInterval` - the interval in milliseconds, which specifies how often flush and sync index changes to disk (default is `15000`, 15 seconds, minimum allowed value is `1000`, 1 second)
 * `translogSyncInterval` - the interval in milliseconds, which specifies how often the transaction log flushes its changes to disk (default is `5000`, 5 seconds, minimum allowed value is `1000`, 1 second)
 * `queryWarnThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log a WARN level message in the log file about a slow query (default value is `400`)
 * `queryInfoThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log an INFO level message in the log file about a slow query (default value is `300`)
 * `queryDebugThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log a DEBUG level message in the log file about a slow query (default value is `100`)
 * `queryTraceThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log a TRACE level message in the log file about a slow query (default value is `50`)
 * `fetchWarnThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log a WARN level message in the log file about a slow fetch (default value is `200`)
 * `fetchInfoThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log an INFO level message in the log file about a slow fetch (default value is `100`)
 * `fetchDebugThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log a DEBUG level message in the log file about a slow fetch (default value is `50`)
 * `fetchTraceThreshold` - threshold in milliseconds, which specifies when to log a TRACE level message in the log file about a slow fetch (default value is `10`)
- New modules:
 * `com.b2international.index.api` - Generic Index API module
 * `com.b2international.index.lucene` - Lucene based implementation of Generic Index API module
 * `com.b2international.index.api.tests` - Generic test cases to verify implementation modules of the Index API module
 * `com.b2international.index.api.tests.tools` - Useful utility classes when writing Index API based test cases
 * `com.b2international.collections.jackson` - Jackson ser/deser module for `com.b2international.collections.api` module

### Changed
- Improved change processing performance by loading only the relevant revisions from the index
- Log entry format of requests has changed to the following
 * The logged entry is now a valid JSON object  
 * Format: `{"repositoryId":"string", "type":"string", "metrics": {...}, ...request specific properties}`
- Metrics
 * All values are measured in milliseconds
 * Read operations measure their execution time (`responseTime`)
 * Commit operations measure their execution time (`responseTime`) and commit subtask execution times (`preCommit`, `preRequest`, `traceability`, `indexing`, `commit`)

### Removed
- Deprecated public SNOMED CT APIs that have been replaced by the new Request based APIs
 * `SnomedTerminologyBrowser`
 * `SnomedStatementBrowser`
 * `SnomedPredicateBrowser`
 * `SnomedComponentService`
 * `SnomedTaxonomyService`
- Configuration options:
 * `indexTimeout` configuration has been removed, because the new index API uses a single index and it does not require disposal of branch specific Index Readers/Writers

## 4.2.0
### Added
- Support for terminology reviews
  * `POST` `/reviews`
  * `GET` `/reviews/:id`
  * `GET` `/reviews/:id/concept-changes`
  * `DELETE` `/reviews/:id`
  
  Changes are computed according to existing version comparison logic in Snow Owl Server; in particular, reference set identifier concepts are marked as changed if any members are added, removed or updated in the reference set. The first modification immediately after versioning triggers an update to "Module dependency", making it appear in concept change resources.
  
  Inbound relationship changes do not mark the target concept as changed. Inactivating a concept marks it as changed, not deleted.
  
  Concept change sets and review resources are kept for a limited time, which is configurable using the `snowowl_configuration.yml` file.

## 4.1.0
### Added
- Deep branching support has been implemented
  * `POST` `/branches` endpoint
  * `GET` `/branches` endpoint
  * `DELETE` `/branches/{path}` endpoint

  * `GET` `/branches/{path}/children` endpoint
  * `POST` `/merges` endpoint

### Changed
- Added support for Unpublished component import. RF2 rows with empty effectiveTime column can be imported into Snow Owl SNOMED CT repository.
- Breaking RESTful API changes
  * `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/...` URLs are replaced with URL beginning with `/{path}/...`, where "path" may include an arbitrary number of `/`-separated segments
- Separate API documentation for each RESTful API
  * `Administrative`: http://localhost:8080/snowowl/admin/
  * `SNOMED CT`: http://localhost:8080/snowowl/snomed-ct/v2/
- API documentation layout
  * Two column layout, one for the API docs and one for the Swagger UI
- Deep branching support for Import/Export configuration (new `branchPath`)
- API version is now included in SNOMED CT REST service URLs; the accepted media type is `application/vnd.com.b2international.snowowl+json` for both Administrative and SNOMED CT terminology services
- Deployment changes: The preferred transaction isolation level is READ-COMMITTED for MySQL databases. For changing the corresponding server variable, refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/set-transaction.html.

### Removed
- Breaking RESTful API changes
  * Removed /tasks API endpoints

### Known issues
- Associated index directories are not purged when a branch and any children are deleted
- Reopening a branch can not be rolled back; if applying changes fails after reopening a branch during rebase or merge operations, previous changes will be lost
- No additional metadata is present on version tag branches

## 2015-03-26
### Added
- `WRP-89`: both `FULL` and `DELTA` imports are now separating incoming import files into "layers" based on the effective time columns, and individual layers get imported in order. This enables importing the `20150131` INT RF2 release delta, which includes components from `20140731` as well. The import process can now create versions after importing each "layer" for all import types.
  
  Note that the above mentioned `20150131` release would require "re-tagging" of an already released `20140731` version, which is not supported, or placing the additional content on the existing `20140731` version branch as a patch. This, however, would make the extra `20140731` content available on that version and that version **only**; it would be visible neither from `MAIN`, nor from `20150131`.
  
  The current implementation issues a warning when such cases are encountered; the extra content will become visible on `MAIN` and `20150131`, but not on version `20140731`, which is left untouched. A possible workaround is to import `20140731` from a delta with disabled version creation, then import the `20150131` delta with enabled version creation.

## 2015-03-19
### Added
- `WRP-135`: added properties `taskId` and `versionId` to the export configuration object to allow exporting content from task branches. URLs for exporting no longer include the version segment.
  * version/taskId is accepted, but not applicable (no tasks on versions)
  * when taskId left out, it means MAIN or head of a particular version
- Added the `transientEffectiveTime` property to the export configuration object for specifying 
effective time values in export files, if unpublished components are present. Valid values are:
  * `""` or not setting the property: uses `Unpublished` in exported files
  * `"NOW"`: uses the current server date in exported files
  * dates in `yyyyMMdd` format, eg. `"20150319"`: uses the specified date in exported files
  * anything else result in return code 400 bad request, date is not validated in terms of earlier/later (only proper format)
  Note: unpublished components are filtered out from `DELTA` exports if the export configuration specifies an ending effective time.

### Changed
- Changed the export service to export components from _all_ modules if the `moduleIds` property of the export configuration object is not set. The previous behavior resulted in empty export files under the assumption that _no_ modules should be exported.
- Querying or exporting a non-existent export config returns now code 404 as opposed to 200 and an empty object.
- After downloading the export result, the export config is cleaned up.

## DEV2.1 - 2015-03-05
### Changed
- Make the `Accept` header mandatory for requests to "B2i" URLs, and produce `application/json` 
responses on "Browser" URLs. This means that the latter endpoints will be hit when entered in a 
web browser's URL bar, making testing easier.
- Increase concept children collection performance by using a combination of low-level calls. This 
brings the test case of `123037004`'s children down from ~22 seconds to ~350 ms.
- Sort description search results by relevance, and add offset and limit to fetch search results in 
smaller segments.
- Split the API documentation into two sets: the administrative interface with the code system 
listing is separated from SNOMED CT services. The API viewer's own URL bar can be used to switch 
between generated documentation endpoints; two shortcuts were also added. The default URL is changed 
to http://localhost:8080/snowowl/admin/api-viewer/ .

## DEV2 - 2015-02-20
### Added
- New API viewer category for URLs specific to the IHTSDO Browser:
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/concepts/{SCTID}` for retrieving concepts and related details
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/concepts/{SCTID}/children` for retrieving concept children
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/descriptions?query={query_string}` for retrieving matching
descriptions
- `GET` `/{tag}[/tasks/{taskId}]/constants` for getting response constant FSNs and identifiers

### Changed
- `effectiveDate` and `effectiveTime` properties on SNOMED CT components and code system
versions now universally follow the short `yyyyMMdd` format (also applies when creating new
versions), other dates should use ISO8601 
- `Accept-Language` is required on all new endpoints which return descriptions, as Snow Owl
Server stores descriptions with different language codes and acceptability side-by-side
- Constants must be retrieved on a version/task basis, as the FSN of these enumeration
values can change between versions, tasks

### Removed
- `isLeafStated` is not returned, as Snow Owl Server holds a mixed set of relationships
which matches the inferred view only

## DEV1 - 2015-02-13
### Added
- `WRP-26`: Support importing deltas without corresponding unchanged artefacts
- `WRP-82`: Enable REST operation to support imports on branches
- `WRP-88`: Add support for namespace to REST API
- Added folder `delta-import-examples` which includes a set of RF2 release .zip 
files, containing the minimally required content for each change. A separate 
`readme.txt` file within the folder has additional instructions on how these 
archives can be used.

### Changed
- URLs under and including `/snomed-ct/imports` no longer require specifying the 
version to use as a path variable;
- The input object for `POST` `/snomed-ct/imports` should now include both the 
version as well as the task identifier, if applicable:
```
{
  "version": "MAIN",
  "taskId": "SO-001",
  "type": "DELTA",
  "languageRefSetId": "900000000000508004",
  "createVersions": false
}
```
- `GET` `/snomed-ct/imports/{importId}` will return information about the ongoing
import and the original values from the import configuration:
```
{
  "type": "DELTA",
  "version": "MAIN",
  "taskId": "SO-001",
  "createVersions": false,
  "languageRefSetId": "900000000000508004",
  "id": "89feb6f4-f6a7-4652-90b9-b89b6b8587ce",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "startDate": "2015-02-13T15:39:56Z",
  "completionDate": "2015-02-13T15:41:05Z"
}
```
### Removed
- To keep the release file's size small, no indexes and SQL dumps have been 
attached; the ones from the previous release can be used instead. A database
reload is required.
