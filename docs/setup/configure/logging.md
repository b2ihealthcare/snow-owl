# Logging configuration

Snow Owl uses [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) and [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) for logging.

The logging configuration file (`serviceability.xml`) can be used to configure Snow Owl logging. The logging configuration file location depends on your installation method, by default it is located in the `${SO_HOME}/configuration` folder.

Extensive information on how to customize logging and all the supported appenders can be found on the [Logback documentation](https://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html).
