# Available APIs

Now that we have our instance up and running, the next step is to understand how to communicate with it. Fortunately, Snow Owl provides very comprehensive and powerful APIs to interact with your instance.

## REST API

Among the few things that can be done with the API are as follows:

* Check your instance health, status, and statistics
* Administer your instance data
* Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) and search operations against your terminologies
* Execute advanced search operations such as paging, sorting, filtering, scripting, aggregations, and many others
