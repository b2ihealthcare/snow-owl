# Building from source

Snow Owl uses Maven for its build system. In order to create a distribution, simply run the following command in the cloned directory. 

    mvn clean package

The distribution packages can be found in the `releng/com.b2international.snowowl.server.update/target` folder, when the build is complete.

To run the test cases, use the following command:

    mvn clean verify

# Development

These instructions will get Snow Owl up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Snow Owl is an Equinox-OSGi based server. To develop plug-ins for Snow Owl you need to use Eclipse as IDE: 
* Use latest Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers package: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/

Required Eclipse plug-ins (install the listed features via `Help` -> `Install New Software...`):

*Note: you may have to untick the `Show only the latest versions of the available software` checkbox to get older versions of a feature. Please use the exact version specified below, not the latest point release.*

* Xtext/Xtend (http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/releases/)
  * MWE 2 language SDK 2.10.0 (MWE)
  * Xtend IDE 2.18.0 (Xtext)
  * Xtext Complete SDK 2.18.0 (Xtext)
* Maven integration (http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases) 
 
### Eclipse Preferences

Make sure you have the following preferences enabled/disabled.
* Plug-in development API baseline errors is set to Ignored (Preferences > Plug-in Development > API Baselines)
* The *Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:2.5:clean* type of errors can be ignored or changed to *Warnings* in *Preferences->Maven->Errors/Warnings*.
* Set the workspace encoding to *UTF-8* (Preferences->General->Workspace)
* Set the line endings to *Unix* style (Preferences->General->Workspace)

### Git configuration

* Make sure the Git line endings are set to *input* (Preferences->Team->Git->Configuration - add key if missing *core.autocrlf = input*)

## First steps

1. Import all projects into your Eclipse workspace and wait for the build to complete
2. Select all projects and hit `Alt` + `F5` and trigger an update to all Maven projects manually (to download dependencies from Maven)
3. Open the `target-platform/target-platform-local.target` file
4. Wait until Eclipse resolves the target platform (click on the `Resolve` button if it refuses to do so) and then click on `Set as Active Target platform`
5. Wait until the build is complete and you have no compile errors
6. Launch `snow-owl-oss` launch configuration in the Run Configurations menu
7. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/snowowl/snomed-ct/v3`

# Acknowledgements

In March 2015, [SNOMED International](http://snomed.org) generously licensed the Snow Owl Terminology Server components supporting SNOMED CT. They subsequently made the licensed code available to their [members](http://www.snomed.org/members) and the global community under an open-source license.

In March 2017, [NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk) licensed the Snow Owl Terminology Server to support the mandatory adoption of SNOMED CT throughout all care settings in the United Kingdom by April 2020. In addition to driving the UKâ€™s clinical terminology efforts by providing a platform to author national clinical codes, Snow Owl will support the maintenance and improvement of the dm+d drug extension which alone is used in over 156 million electronic prescriptions per month. Improvements to the terminology server made under this agreement will be made available to the global community. 

Many other organizations have directly and indirectly contributed to Snow Owl, including: Singapore Ministry of Health; American Dental Association; University of Nebraska Medical Center (USA); Federal Public Service of Public Health (Belgium); Danish Health Data Authority; Health and Welfare Information Systems Centre (Estonia); Department of Health (Ireland); New Zealand Ministry of Health; Norwegian Directorate of eHealth; Integrated Health Information Systems (Singapore); National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden); eHealth Suisse (Switzerland); and the National Library of Medicine (USA).
